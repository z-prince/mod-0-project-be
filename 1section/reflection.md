## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel comfortable asking questions after I ahve invested a sufficient amount of time and effort looking for the answer on my own.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
`puts "Hello World!"`
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
The pound sign or octothorpe (#)

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is a whole number and less accurate while a floating number adds the decimal and is more accurate.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is the practice of seeding a string inside of another string.

`puts "My favorite animal is a #{zebra}!"'

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

The `gets` method is used to retrieve input from a user.
