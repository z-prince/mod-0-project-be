# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal: 
# `ruby section3/exercises/hashes.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints a hash holding grocery store inventory:
foods = {apples: 23, grapes: 507, eggs: 48}
p foods

# Write code that prints a hash holding zoo animal inventory:
zoo = {zebras: 23, lions: 15, tigers: 41, bears: 16, oh_my: 1}
p zoo

# Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the zoo variable 
# you created above:
puts zoo.keys

# Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the zoo variable 
# you created above:
puts zoo.values

# Write code that prints the value of the first animal of the zoo variable 
# you created above:
puts zoo.values[0]

# Write code that adds an animal to the zoo hash. 
# Then, print the updated hash:
zoo [:goats] = 13
puts zoo

# Part 2: Email
#-------------------


# Think about all the pieces of information associated with one single email in your inbox.
# It has a sender, a subject, ...

# Declare a variable that stores hash. Each key should be an attribute of an email and each
# value should be some appropriate value for that key. Work to have at least 5 key-value pairs.
email = {header: 0, subject: 1, cc: 2, signature: 3, body: 4}
# Write code that prints your email hash to the terminal.
puts email


# Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the email hash 
# you created above:
puts email.keys

# Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the email hash 
# you created above:
puts email.values

# Part 3: Many Emails - OPTIONAL EXTENSION
#-------------------

# LONG EXAMPLE:
# Now that we've learned about Hashes AND Arrays, we can combine them.

# Check out the following example of an array of Instagram posts:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"]


# An Array of Hashes is probably more realistic. Hashes are a data type that's great
# for storing more complex data. Below, we can store multiple key-value pairs
# that relate to each individual Instagram post:


posts = [
  {
    image_src: "./images/beach.png",
    caption: "At the beach with my besties",
    timestamp: "4:37 PM August 13, 2019",
    number_likes: 0,
    comments: []
  }, 
  {
    image_src: "./images/holiday-party.png",
    caption: "What a great holiday party omg",
    timestamp: "11:37 PM December 31, 2019",
    number_likes: 13,
    comments: []
  }
  
]

p posts
p posts[0]


# The code snippet above shows an Array with 2 elements. Each element in the Array is a 
# Hash. Each of those Hashes has 4 key-value pairs. This may LOOK 
# a bit daunting - it's OK! You don't need to be 100% comfortable with this, but it's
# good to have some exposure before going into Mod 1.


# YOU DO: Create an array of at least 3 EMAIL Hashes, using the same 
# key-value pairs you used in your email Hash above.
# Then, print the email Array to the terminal.

email = [
  {
    title: "Peer Review",
    font: "Times New Roman",
    timestamp: "20220114 20:32"
  },
  {
    title: "Quarterly Peer Reviews",
    font: "Times New Roman",
    timestamp: "20220114 20:29"
  },
  {
    recipients: "toomuchtime@gmail.com, nobodyusesthis@aol.com, nobodyusesmeeither@ymail.com, ilookprofessional@outlook.com",
    font: "Times New Roman",
    timestamp: "20220114 20:25"
  }
]

puts email
states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}

puts states.values[1]
